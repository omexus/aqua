# Monorepo Setup Complete! 🎉

Your Aqua workspace has been successfully converted into a monorepo with the following structure and features:

## 📁 What Was Created/Modified

### Root Level Files
- `package.json` - Workspace configuration with development scripts
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development services (DynamoDB Local)
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `.gitignore` - Monorepo-specific ignore patterns
- `scripts/dev-setup.sh` - Development setup script

### Shared Directory (`shared/`)
- `types.ts` - Common TypeScript interfaces
- `api-client.ts` - Shared API client with auth handling
- `package.json` - Shared package configuration
- `index.ts` - Package exports

## 🚀 Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run setup` | Complete development setup (Docker + dependencies) |
| `npm run dev` | Start both API and frontend |
| `npm run dev:api` | Start only the .NET API |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Start only the React frontend |
| `npm run docker:up` | Start DynamoDB Local |
| `npm run docker:down` | Stop local services |
| `npm run build` | Build both applications |
| `npm run clean` | Clean build artifacts |

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Start Docker Desktop** (required for DynamoDB Local)

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy your API configuration to `api/appsettings.Development.json`
   - Create `frontend/.env` with your API URL and Google OAuth settings

4. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

└── docker-compose.yml  # Local development services
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

- **Shared Types**: Both frontend and API use the same TypeScript interfaces
- **API Client**: Frontend uses the shared API client with auth handling
- **Local Development**: DynamoDB Local for consistent development environment
- **Build System**: Unified build and development scripts

## 🎯 Benefits of This Setup

1. **Unified Development**: Single command to start everything
2. **Shared Code**: Common types and utilities
3. **Consistent Environment**: Docker-based local services
4. **Simplified Deployment**: Centralized build and deployment scripts
5. **Better Collaboration**: Single repository for the entire application

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running before using `npm run setup`
- The API is configured to use DynamoDB Local for development
- Environment variables need to be configured for production deployment
- The frontend expects the API to be running on `http://localhost:5000`

Your monorepo is now ready for development! 🚀
